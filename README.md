# Dye-Indicator-Model
Acid–base dye indicators exist as two pH-dependent conjugated forms, and their observed spectra can be modeled as a continuum between these forms — effectively a mixture of two dyes. The figure below shows the conjugated structures for bromothymol blue.

The model is then:

The critical attributes, specifically the spectra at the conjugated extremes and the pH-dependent peak absorption of each conjugated form, can be obtained or digitized from open-sourced lit (the digitized attributes for bromothymol blue are provided as .csv in this repository).  Once obtained or digitized, the attributes can be plotted as shown below:

where the dashed vertical lines on the right graph bound the physiological pH range.
